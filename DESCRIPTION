Description: Preprocessing of raw temperature data (python scripts) that was collected over the period
of one brick firing process in a traditional clamp kiln in Malawi. Simulation of Heat
distribution in different clamp designs. Analysis of the resulting brick quality depending
on the achieved, simulated temperatures (MATLAB).
